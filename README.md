# CS-330-Showcase

When it came to designing this program my focus was on ecapsulation and abstraction. Rather than leaving everything in one main application for the most part I felt it was better practice to separate when possible and make things reusable as well. as for the design process there was a lot implemented on paper with how I wanted things to look and seeing if it made sense to abstract out certain parts of the code. When designing this scene most of the time was spent playing with the finer details to make sure things were placed right and everything looked correct. Persistence and patience were probably the two most practiced skills when working on this as it was difficult to get some things working properly. I used a lot of pencil and paper to help visualize objects and space before I started actually creating the scene. As I worked on each part of the project I was able to implement new things into creating and setting the scene. As for how this all will impact me going forward, it has helped me gain a better understanding of some concepts that I have touched on in other classes, especially revisiting some of the mathematics involved in creating the scene space and the lightining elements.
